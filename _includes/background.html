      I'm currently leading a cross-functional team in the energy sector, deploying AI pipelines and autonomous drones for precision infrastructure-health inspection, monitoring, and research. Our work spans edge-to-cloud—onboard inference, fleet operations, and data quality loops—to deliver fast, actionable insights for grid assets, pipelines, and renewable installations.

      Recently, I've been focused on building AI clusters optimized for inference: power-efficient nodes with high-throughput networking and quantized models. We pair GPU/NPU accelerators with fast NVMe, use partitioning (e.g., MIG) where available, and serve via Triton or ONNX Runtime. With Kubernetes orchestration, node feature discovery, and GPU operators, plus TensorRT/ONNX graph fusion, INT8/FP8 quantization, smart batching, and result caching, we achieve low-latency, high-throughput inference with strong cost efficiency.

      As a Bioengineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and high alpha generating commercialization &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my metal models for high reward product design. My goal is to always build and commercialize technology and  business models that are scalable
      and efficient across market dynamics, all with an aim to take a calculated risk on disrruptive innovation with a possible exponationl upside in the foreseeable future .

      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
